### Overview of the Solution

The task scheduling application is designed to help astronauts organize their daily tasks efficiently. The application implements core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations while ensuring that tasks do not overlap. This solution adheres to best coding practices and incorporates key design patterns: Singleton, Factory, and Observer.

### Key Functional Requirements

1. **Add, Remove, and View Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a description, start time, end time, and priority level. They can also remove existing tasks and view all tasks sorted by start time.
2. **Task Overlap Validation**: The application checks for conflicts when adding tasks to prevent overlapping schedules.
3. **Error Handling**: The system provides appropriate error messages for invalid operations, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

### Design Patterns Implemented

1. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - **Purpose**: To ensure that only one instance of the `ScheduleManager` exists throughout the application, facilitating centralized task management.
   - **Implementation**: The `ScheduleManager` class has a private static instance variable and a private constructor. The `getInstance()` method controls the instantiation process.
   - **Benefit**: This pattern simplifies state management and ensures consistency in task management.

2. **Factory Pattern**:
   - **Purpose**: To abstract the creation of `Task` objects, allowing for easier modification and management of task creation logic.
   - **Implementation**: The `TaskFactory` class contains a static method `createTask()` that encapsulates the logic for creating `Task` objects. This keeps the task creation separate from the business logic in the main application.
   - **Benefit**: This approach promotes code reusability and maintainability, making it easier to adapt the task creation process in the future.

3. **Observer Pattern**:
   - **Purpose**: To notify various components (observers) of changes in the task schedule, such as the addition of a new task or conflicts with existing tasks.
   - **Implementation**: The `Observer` interface defines the update method, and `TaskObserver` implements this interface to handle notifications. The `ScheduleManager` maintains a list of observers and calls the `notifyObservers()` method when changes occur.
   - **Benefit**: This pattern enhances the application's scalability and flexibility by allowing new observers to be added easily without modifying the core logic.

### Code Structure

1. **Task Class**: Represents individual tasks with attributes like description, start time, end time, and priority. It includes methods to mark a task as completed and format the task for display.

2. **TaskFactory Class**: Responsible for creating `Task` objects, centralizing the instantiation logic.

3. **ScheduleManager Class**: Implements the Singleton pattern and manages the task list. It includes methods for adding, removing, and retrieving tasks, as well as validating overlaps and notifying observers.

4. **Observer Interface and TaskObserver Class**: Define and implement the observer functionality, allowing for notifications about task changes.

5. **AstronautScheduleApp Class**: The main entry point for the application. It provides a console-based user interface for interacting with the task scheduler, allowing users to perform operations based on menu selections.

### Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling:
- Validates time format using regex to ensure inputs are in HH:mm format.
- Checks for overlapping tasks before adding a new task and provides clear error messages if conflicts arise.
- Informs users if they attempt to remove a task that does not exist.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Compile the Application**: Use the Java compiler to compile all classes.
2. **Run the Application**: Start the console application to interact with the task scheduler.
3. **User Interaction**: Users can navigate through the menu to add tasks, view them, remove tasks, mark them as completed, or filter by priority.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently addresses the problem of managing a daily schedule for astronauts while ensuring scalability and maintainability through the use of well-established design patterns. By leveraging the Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns, the application is structured for future enhancements and robust enough for real-world usage.
